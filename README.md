"# ukusiSrema" 
This is my school project that was rebuild several times. First it was just template with basic information about products (only html,css,js), then I added admin panel and registration options using php and sql, and finally I reorganised code to mvc style. This project has shop that provides infromation about products, then you can add your products to cart, but only authorised users can buy. When you log, you see your personal infromation and your previous purchases. Every segment is controled by admin from admin panel.
